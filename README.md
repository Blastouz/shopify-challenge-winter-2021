__Preambule__

Hi, I am Baptiste, actually in a career change from engineering to web Development. As you may have notice (and if not, for sure you will), I am still learning.
This application was made for the 2021 Fall Internship, where my application was not accepted. I cloned it and continue working on it.

I still had a lot of fun building this small app, and I hope you will enjoy the same as I had to make it !

__Features :__

The idea behind this app is to display images stocked from an Url or a FTP server (I used AWS, switching from cloudinary, just to try it).

You have to log in if you want to post an image, edit, and see the images already in the Database. I did put some Tests but as you can see they fail : this is a part I couldnt cover with the amount of time left. 

__Gems used__ :

simple_form to improve forms
Devise as an authentificator
AWD to store images
capybara and selenium for system tests
